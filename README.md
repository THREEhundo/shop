## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Animate.css

I created the front end for an e-commerce donut shop. Users have the ability to login and order donuts. The app consists of 4 sections, the landing page, about, catalogue, and cart. 

## Optimizations

Need to hide mobile menu when clicking on the login li. Have the cart icon update when quanity is changed by the user. Come on back button on the index needs breathing room on mobile view.

## Lessons Learned:

With this project I learned why frameworks like React are used. Creating a page for each individual product is cumbersome being that not much changes besides the specifics of a single product. Having a template and sending the relevant information is a much easier way of creating web apps.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
